to run graph.py

Navigate to DeterlabControl/nodecontrol/

First remember the graph needs 4 arguments
run ---->  python graph.py master outstation1 outstation2 outstation3 10
   where 10 is the time in seconds
   
bug: adding control to the node options generates an error. 
Which probably mean that adding a node without traffic would generate an error too
